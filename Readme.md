(A.I. api call doesn't work yet - I must integrate with Langchain4J)

## How it works

A.I. Reply Arena allows users to:

- Ask a single question to multiple AI models.
- View responses side-by-side.
- Choose the best answer.
- Experiment with AI model performance and creativity.

This project is a work in progress and designed for developers and AI enthusiasts to test and compare AI responses.

## Features

- Multi-model query support.
- Interactive UI to display responses.
- Backend API handling multiple AI providers.
- Dockerized for easy setup and deployment.

## How I made it:

Straight up vibe coding. 

No thoughts, other than design, went into this project and it turned out functional - Pure "prompt engineering"

Can't blame someone for having fun, can you?
